cfitsio is a Yorick plugin for the cfitsio library, with some
high level routines.

0/Informations
   The file 'include/fitsio.h' is NOT used for the compilation.
   The compiler uses the 'fitsio.h' file found in the Make.cfg
   This 'include/fitsio.h' is only used to dynamically recompute the
   'yorick/cfitsioPluginWrapper.i' file based on rules defined in
   '../../tools/congig/*' and 'config/userTemplate.xml'

1/Prerequisite:
1.1/ Yorick
    yorick >= 2.1 should be installed.
    cfitsioPlugin is known to compile with yorick
    2.1.01 (tested on MacOSX), 2.1.02 (MacOSX)

1.2/ CFITSIO
    cfitsio library should be installed on your computer. You
    need 'libcfitsio.a' and 'fitsio.h' The wrapper is known to compile
    with cfitsio version 2.51 but not with cfitsio 3.

2/ Installation:
2.1/ Prepare Makefile
    Enter in src directory, and edit Make.cfg file
    so that the compiler can find the requested include and
    library files (fitsio.h and libcfitsio.a)

2.2/ Compile and install
    To compile, execute from src directory: 
        make clean all
    To test the plugin, execute form src directory:
        make test
    To install the plugin in your yorick architecture,
    execute from the src directory:
        make install_plugin

3/ Add CFITSIO functions:
    You can add a wrapper for a cfitsio function not already wrapped
    by un-commted it in include/cfitsio.h, then execute
        make update
    in the yorick/ directory and then
        make clean all install_plugin
    from the src/ directory. Note that the best would be to also
    add an interpreted function protecting your wrapper in the
    yorick/cfitsioPlugin.i file.
