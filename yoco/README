*** Introduction ***
********************

YOCO (stands for YOrick COntributions) is a series of contributions in
the form of scripts or mini-plugins. These contributions range from
string manipulation, documentation maintenance, Astronomy toolbox, CDS
input/output routines, up to a genuine yorick graphical interface file
browser.

The yoco plugin is meant to be used with yorick v>1.6.
Several modules exists that can be compiled independently. They are
the following:
- a yorick cfitsio plugin
- a yorick fftw2 plugin
- a specific plugin called "yoco" to handle specific error types and
so on
- a series of packages using the features of yoco.

Yoco is distributed under the GPL licence (see COPYING file). Authors
of this software are listed in the AUTHORS file.

The software provided in the "distrib" subdirectory (yorick, fftw, &
cfitsio) have their own licences (see details in the packages).

The catalogs provided in the "catalogs" subdirectory and used in the
calibration routines come from the CDS

********************
*** Requirements ***
********************

You need an installed version of yorick and a specific environment
variable called INTROOT where the yorick software is installed. The
plugins needs the following libraries and softwares:
- cfitsio v>2490
- fftw2 v>2.1.5 <3.X 
- yorick v>1.6, which need itself readline and rlterm.
For convenience, these packages are distributed together with yoco in
the "distrib" subdirectory, and can be compiled together with the
package.

********************
*** Installation ***
********************

* Quick way:
To build the different necessary softwares and libraries, go to the
yoco/distrib directory and type in:
$ ./install.sh 
(You can add the -h option to get detail on the way to use your libs)

A series of questions are asked in an interactive way to compile and
install the different libraries and softwares.

* Detailed way:
You have to go to the different places to compile the plugins:

cd yoco/packages
make clean all install

cd ../plugins/cfitsio/src/
make clean all install
cd ../yorick/
make clean all install

cd ../../yoco/src/
make clean all install
cd ../yorick/
make clean all install

cd ../../fftw/src/
make clean all install
cd ../yorick/
make clean all install

cd ../../../doc
yorick -batch generateAllDocs.i

Notes:
The fftw3 is now included into the distrib directory but the
associated yoco plugin will be set up on demand.
